# Projects for _Estructura de Sistemas Operativos_

[![es](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-es-red.svg)](/README-ES.md)

This repository holds the solution to the projects laid out at [this repository](https://github.com/bsahelices/laboratorio-eso), consisting of several common tools (cat, grep, zip, unzip) and a custom shell. It was developed as homework for the course _Estructura de Sistemas Operativos_ (OS Structure) of Computer Science at University of Valladolid.

The folder structure is the same as that repository, with the solution to `Practica1` and `Practica2` but without all the testing tools. Both the code and the compiled programs are provided.
